Simple BFS method.
Submission page: https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/649840595/
There are clearly faster submissions on that page, but when I tested them again, the fastest "7 ms submission" actually took 45ms, and the "11 ms submission" with DSU algorithm actually took 31ms. I didn't test more submissions, I think my submission is probably the fastest.
